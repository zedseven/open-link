# open-link
A dead-simple program that facilitates opening web apps and other
URLs from programs that launch executables (Steam).

## Usage
```commandline
open-link https://github.com/zedseven/open-link
```

## Why
Originally made so that I could have
[Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com)
as a 'game' in my Steam game list for easy access.
